# Practice 2

**Topic:** Parallel implementation of sorting algorithms using OpenMP

## Description
This practice work is dedicated to studying simple sorting algorithms and their parallel implementation on CPU using OpenMP.  
Sequential and parallel versions are compared by execution time.

## Tasks
- Implementation of sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
- Parallelization using OpenMP
- Performance testing on arrays of different sizes
- Time measurement using the <chrono> library

## Files
Each task folder contains:
- C++ source code with comments
- Answers to control questions
- Screenshot of console output
