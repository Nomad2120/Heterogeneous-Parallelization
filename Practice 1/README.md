# Practice 1

**Topic:** Introduction to C/C++ basics and data structures

## Description
This practice work focuses on basic C/C++ concepts: arrays, pointers, dynamic memory and simple data structures.  
Sequential and parallel processing using OpenMP is introduced.

## Tasks
- Work with arrays (min, max, output)
- Parallel computation using OpenMP
- Implementation of data structures:
  - Singly linked list
  - Stack
  - Queue
- Dynamic memory allocation using pointers
- Sequential and parallel computation of average value

## Files
Each task folder contains:
- C++ source code with comments
- Answers to control questions
- Screenshot of console output
